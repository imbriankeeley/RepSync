# RepSync

A simple, **offline-first** Android workout app. Log workouts, build templates, track progress—all on your device. No account required.

## Features

- **Guest-first** — Use the app immediately; optional local profile (name, avatar) only.
- **Workout templates** — Create and save workouts with exercises and sets; start from a template anytime.
- **Quick Workout** — Add exercises on the fly without a template.
- **Calendar** — Month view with completed workouts; tap a day to see details, copy workouts to other days, or save a day's workout as a template.
- **Progress** — "Previous" weight/reps per exercise from your history.
- **Local only** — All data stays on your device (Room/SQLite). No cloud, no sign-in in v1.

## Requirements

- **Android** only (no iOS in initial scope).
- Min SDK 26; target SDK 35.
- **Architecture:** Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, single-activity, MVVM.

## Building the App

### Prerequisites

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (or the Android SDK + command-line tools).
- JDK 17+.

### Build Commands

**Debug (development):**
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
Output: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

**Release (unsigned):**
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
Output: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk`

**Release (signed — see [Signing for Release](#signing-for-release) below):**
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
Output: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Run on a Device

Install the debug APK directly:
```bash
./gradlew installDebug
```
Or open the project in Android Studio and run on an emulator or connected device.

## Signing for Release

To produce a signed APK suitable for distribution you need a Java keystore. **Never commit your keystore or passwords to the repo.**

### 1. Generate a Keystore (one-time)

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -keystore repsync-release.jks \
  -alias repsync \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000
```

Store the `.jks` file somewhere safe outside the repo.

### 2. Configure Signing Properties

Create (or edit) `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` and add:

```properties
REPSYNC_KEYSTORE_FILE=/absolute/path/to/repsync-release.jks
REPSYNC_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_store_password
REPSYNC_KEY_ALIAS=repsync
REPSYNC_KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
```

The `app/build.gradle.kts` already reads these properties. When they are set, `assembleRelease` produces a signed APK. When they are absent, the build falls back to an unsigned APK.

### 3. Build the Signed APK

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The signed APK is at:
```
app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

> **Tip:** For CI (e.g. GitHub Actions), set the four `REPSYNC_*` values as repository secrets and write the keystore from a base64 secret.

## Distribution via Obtainium

[Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) installs and updates Android apps directly from GitHub Releases—no app store required.

### For Users

1. Install [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) on your Android device.
2. Open Obtainium and tap **Add App**.
3. Enter this repo's URL as the source (e.g. `https://github.com/<user>/RepSync`).
4. Obtainium will find the latest GitHub Release and its APK asset.
5. Install (and later update) from there.

### For Maintainers — Publishing a Release

1. Bump `versionCode` and `versionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts`.
2. Build the signed release APK:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```
3. Create a new **GitHub Release**:
   - Go to **Releases > Draft a new release** on the repo.
   - Create a tag (e.g. `v1.0.0`) matching the `versionName`.
   - Add release notes describing what changed.
   - Attach `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` as a release asset.
4. Publish the release. Obtainium users who added this repo will see the update.
